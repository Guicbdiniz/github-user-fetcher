<!-- TROUBLES -->
## Troubles

As it was a simple project with a quite vague set of requirements, I didn't had much trouble developing it.  
  
That being said, I haven't got much experience with web design (and it is not a subject that I plan on learning much about), so I decided to make it as simple as I could.  
  
Although I don't think that front-end is my favourite development area, I really enjoy working with the React framework.
